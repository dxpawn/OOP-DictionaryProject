## Description
The application under discussion has been meticulously architected to facilitate the acquisition and mastery of the English language. 
It is developed utilizing the robust Java programming language, further enhanced by the integration of the JavaFX library, which provides a (not so) sophisticated graphical user interface framework. 
Architecturally, the application adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm, ensuring a clear separation of concerns, which (kind of) enhances maintainability and scalability.

Highlights:
-  Bifurcated dictionary functionality, encompassing both English-Vietnamese and Vietnamese-English lexicons.
-  The repositories for linguistic data within this application are contained within two distinct text files, named E_V.txt and V_E.txt respectively.

## Installation
1. Initiate the duplication of the project by executing a clone operation from the designated remote repository. This process involves retrieving the entirety of the project's digital artifacts and codebase, thereby enabling a local instantiation of the projectâ€™s framework and dependencies.

2. Proceed to engage with the cloned entity by launching your integrated development environment (IDE) of choice. Within this environment, navigate to the option that allows for the importing or opening of existing projects, and select the directory where the cloned repository has been instantiated. This action ensures that all project configurations and dependencies are correctly aligned with the IDE's operational parameters.

3. Subsequently, initiate the execution of the project. This is typically accomplished through the IDEâ€™s built-in mechanisms for compiling and running Java applications. Locate the appropriate menu or toolbar in the IDE that facilitates the running of projects, and select the corresponding command to activate the project's runtime environment.

4. Should there be a necessity or desire to modify the existing dataset within the application, this can be achieved by accessing and altering the contents of the E_V.txt and V_E.txt files. These files house the essential data elements used by the applicationâ€™s dictionary feature. Utilize a text editor, either within the IDE or another preferred utility, to make the requisite modifications to the text files, ensuring the changes reflect the updated or corrected translations or vocabulary as required by the userâ€™s specifications or objectives.

## Usage
1. **Select Your Dictionary**: Oh, what a monumental task lies before you! Should you choose English-Vietnamese or Vietnamese-English? This is your chance to pretend you're engaging in something resembling intellectual activity. Pick wisely, or as wisely as you can, given the circumstances.
2. **Type Like It Matters**: Here's a task fit for your skills: type anything into the search bar. That's right, anything at all. The list below will update automaticallyâ€”because, let's face it, we wouldn't want to overtax your abilities with anything more strenuous than basic typing.
3. **Behold the CRUD Button**: See that "CRUD Operations" button? It's practically screaming for attention, right in front of your eyes. Go on, give it a click. Itâ€™s probably the most productive thing youâ€™ll do today.
4. **Preserve Your Mediocrity**: Done fiddling around? Excellent. Hit the Save button (yes, the little disk icon, a nostalgic tribute to a time when technology was as simple as your understanding of it). This will save your changes, enshrining your minimal effort for posterity.
5. **Mimic Pronunciation**: Ready to sound moderately educated? Click the "speak" button for an American twang, or "speak with tea" for the British lilt. Itâ€™s about as close as youâ€™ll get to sophisticationâ€”enjoy the illusion.
6. **Spice Up Your Dull Existence**: Feeling adventurous, are we? There's a "die by a rope" button to play hangman. Itâ€™s a game where guessing half the alphabet might just be within your grasp. Good luckâ€”you'll need it.
7. **Escape (The Usual Way)**: When the burden of this high-intellect endeavor becomes too much, press Alt + F4 or click the X buttonâ€”like the quitter that you are. Itâ€™s the digital equivalent of running away, something youâ€™re undoubtedly familiar with.

## Future improvements
1. More dictionaries, so you get the illusion of choices.
2. Add more complex games. Imagine having to solve a triple integral to close your dictionary, else say goodbye to your System32!
3. Optimize the word lookup algorithm.
4. Use a Trie because a Trie is superior than your typical puny Maps. Plus, being able to implement a Trie makes you intimidating in your OOP class. Your then brilliance and mental capacity will be overwhelming for the ordinary lame TreeMap users.
5. Integrate the application with API of Google Translate to translate paragraphs and whole documents.
6. Integrate the application with API of Google Speech to Text to convert speech to text.
7. Learn a bit of CSS and make the UI less of an eyesore.

## Project status
The project is not very completed, but I ran out of time. It's supposed to be a 3-man project...

## Notes
The application is written for educational and comedy purposes ðŸ¤¡.
